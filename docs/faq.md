# Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the performance compared to PyEmma?
This depends heavily on the task, but in general it should be comparable or even faster, see [Benchmark](../benchmark/).

### Feature X is missing
First, if you are looking for a feature complete package, I would recommand you to take a look at [pyemma](https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA) and [msmbuilder](https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder). If you believe that a crucial functionality/method is missing, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/moldyn/msmhelper/issues) and describe the missing functionality and why it should be added. Alternatively, you can implement it yourself and create a PR to add it to this package, see [contributing guide](../contributing).


### I found a bug. What to do next?
If you find a bug in this package, it is very kind of you to open an issue/bug report.
