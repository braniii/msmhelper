    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the context of biochemical systems, understanding the kinetics of protein dynamics is critical for gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms of biological function. The Markov state model provides a powerful framework for characterizing the kinetics of a system. One can use it to estimate the waiting times $t^\\text{wt}$ between transitions, the transition path times $t^\\text{tt}$, and the pathways that the system takes between states.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that waiting times $t^\\text{wt}$, transition path times $t^\\text{tt}$, and means first passage times $t^\\text{mfpt}$ are related but distinct quantities. Waiting times are the times between individual transitions. Transition path times, on the other hand, are the times required for the system to traverse a particular path between two states. Finally, mean first passage times are the average times required for the system to reach a particular state for the first time. In general, it holds that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t^\\text{wt} \\ge t^\\text{mfpt} \\ge t^\\text{tt}\\;.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In general, we are interested in comparisons with experiments. For example, in biochemical experiments, one can measure the times required for a system (an ensemble) to transition from one state to another. Since this directly corresponds to the waiting time distribution, we mainly focus on it and try to relate it to the corresponding pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on the waiting times and transition path times and show how to estimate them using either the Markov state model or directly the state trajectory. We will also discuss how to visualize the pathways and interpret the results in the context of the toy system being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Systems\n",
    "In the following we will use two simple toy models introduced and discussed by Nagel et al. 20, namely, the following 4-state and 6-state models"
