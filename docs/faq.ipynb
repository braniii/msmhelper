    "### Feature X is missing\n",
    "If you are looking for a feature complete package, I would recommand you to take a look at [pyemma](https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA) and [msmbuilder](https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder). If you believe that a crucial functionality/method is missing, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/moldyn/msmhelper/issues)."
